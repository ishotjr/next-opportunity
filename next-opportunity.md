## About Me

Sometimes I find it hard to describe what I do, since I'm excited and curious about so many things; if I had to sum it all up in one word, perhaps "Enthusiast"!  

I spent the last 7+ years on a venture-backed startup called [Larky](https://nudge.larky.com/) - following an initial consulting gig, I was the first hire after two non-technical founders. [Read more about this journey...](#/6)

## My Passions

So "CTO" may be what I "do", but I ***do*** so many other things! I spend most of my free time hacking on hardware projects and creating communities and content. I have [participated in](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr) and won [oh](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/hexy-a-virtual-pet-that-spurs-good-decisions-7fa74c) [so](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/iorct-the-internet-of-radio-controlled-things-8a6bed) [many](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/whendi-iot-empowered-collaborative-baby-care-9432f0) [hackathons](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/campable-the-internet-of-tents-4bd80b) and [contests](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/smrt-sensor-based-model-rocket-telemetry-b9ddac), the most impactful of which was the [Pebble Rocks Boulder](https://www.hackster.io/team-hack-dads/pebble-altimeter-smart-strap-aa01b9) hackathon, in Boulder, Colorado. [Oh, there's lots more about this...](#/5)

## Entrepreneur

People find it strange when I can't remember how many companies I own or have started, but I'm often working on so many things in parallel that it's true! I started my first company, Barclay Consulting, when I was still at the [University of Michigan Honors College](https://lsa.umich.edu/honors), and built Talent Management systems for [Ann Arbor SPARK](https://annarborusa.org/) and the [Michigan Economic Development Corporation](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/press-releases/2011/07/medc-launches-one-stop-talent-portal-for-skilled-job-seekers-employers/).

I started [Tiny RC, Inc.](http://shop.tinyrc.com/) and [Mini-ZRacer.com](http://mini-zracer.com/) when I discovered a disconnect between US hobby retailers and consumers who wanted the latest, small-scale radio control cars and parts from Japan and Hong Kong. I co-founded **myndrgo** with [Lakshmi Halasyamani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmi-halasyamani-b09b6091) and [Matthew M Davis, MD](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=35745), exploring ways to use technology to empower people to make better health decisions.  

[keeping going down, there's more!](#/3/2)...  


I co-founded **FLIP-FLOP IO, LLC**, focusing on low-cost home automation solutions, wearables, and STEM tools. And I founded [Rebble Alliance, LLC](http://rebble.io/) - but there's [a whole section coming up on that](#/5)...

## The rest...

When I'm not running however many businesses or starting new ones, [being interviewed for high-profile tech blogs](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-undead-gadgets.html), answering Rebble support tickets, or winning hackathons, I'm mostly focusing on Machine Learning on embedded devices. I attended the first ever [Arm AIoT Dev Summit](http://ishotjr.com/first-arm-aiot-dev-summit-in-pictures/) in December as a guest of Arm, and while I was already extremely interested in this area before, it served as a real catalyst for obsession with this technology.

I founded the offical [tinyML meetup for Michigan](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Ann-Arbor-MI/), and am an Official Ambassador for [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/). I'm currently working on an ML-powered companion robot pig (with moving wings!), an ML-enabled baby monitor, and apparently [making The Oatmeal's day](https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1267118660251815937) by creating a [working Quarantine Smartwatch](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/1266874260750045185).  



## Pebble

I was a backer of the [first Pebble](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android?ref=profile_created) and every subsequent model, and would spend all weekend creating watchfaces like [`PW-DOS`](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/550f2f3a46cb79c9bc000044?query=pw-dos&section=watchfaces) and watchapps like [Pokemon GO Radar](http://ishotjr.com/pokemon-go-radar-pebble-watchapp-poc/). But PRB combined my passion for Pebble with my ferver for hardware hacking and began an even greater obsession. After [winning](https://www.hackster.io/team-hack-dads/pebble-altimeter-smart-strap-aa01b9) that hackathon, I became involved with Pebble in every way I could, as a "Rockstar", organizing local meetups, as an appstore reviewer, and as a contributor to a book.  

[keep going!](#/5/1)...  


## Rebble

I embraced every opportunity possible - until the fateful day when we learned Pebble was to be no more. This caused me to write [a loveletter to the community](http://ishotjr.com/a-love-letter-to-pebble-and-the-pebble-community/), and more importantly, to [found a new organization, Rebble](https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html), the unofficial spearhead organization for continuing the advancement of the Pebble platform via the amazing Pebble developer community.
