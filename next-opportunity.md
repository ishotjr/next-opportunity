###### (often known as)

Excitedly seeking my next opportunity!  

Areas of interest / roles:  

#### <a href="#/7" class="internal">CTO</a> / <a href="#/3" class="internal">Technical Co-Founder</a></a> / <a href="#/5" class="internal">Developer Advocate</a></a> / <a href="#/4/1" class="internal">Community Builder</a></a> / <a href="#/8" class="internal">Technical Writer</a></a> / <a href="#/2" class="internal">Maker</a></a> / <a href="#/3" class="internal">Entrepreneur</a>



## About Me

Sometimes I find it hard to describe what I do, since I'm excited and curious about so many things; if I had to sum it all up in one word, perhaps "Enthusiast"!  

I spent the last 7+ years on a venture-backed startup called [Larky](https://nudge.larky.com/) - following an initial consulting gig, I was the first hire after two non-technical founders. <a href="#/7" class="internal">Read more about this journey...</a>  

<a href="#/2" class="internal">or continue</a>...  



## My Passions

So "CTO" may be what I "do", but I ***do*** so many other things! I spend most of my free time hacking on hardware projects and creating communities and content. I have [participated in](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr) and won [oh](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/hexy-a-virtual-pet-that-spurs-good-decisions-7fa74c) [so](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/iorct-the-internet-of-radio-controlled-things-8a6bed) [many](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/whendi-iot-empowered-collaborative-baby-care-9432f0) [hackathons](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/campable-the-internet-of-tents-4bd80b) and [contests](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/smrt-sensor-based-model-rocket-telemetry-b9ddac), the most impactful of which was the [Pebble Rocks Boulder](https://www.hackster.io/team-hack-dads/pebble-altimeter-smart-strap-aa01b9) hackathon, in Boulder, Colorado. <a href="#/5" class="internal">Oh, there's lots more about this...</a>  

<a href="#/3" class="internal">but maybe just keep reading for now</a>...  



## Entrepreneur

People find it strange when I can't remember how many companies I have started, but I'm often working on so many things in parallel that it's true! I started my first company, Barclay Consulting, when I was still at the [University of Michigan Honors College](https://lsa.umich.edu/honors), and built Talent Management systems for [Ann Arbor SPARK](https://annarborusa.org/) and the [Michigan Economic Development Corporation](https://www.michiganbusiness.org/press-releases/2011/07/medc-launches-one-stop-talent-portal-for-skilled-job-seekers-employers/).

<a href="#/3/1" class="internal">more below if you're interested in this stuff</a>...  


I started [Tiny RC, Inc.](http://shop.tinyrc.com/) and [Mini-ZRacer.com](http://mini-zracer.com/) when I discovered a disconnect between US hobby retailers and consumers who wanted the latest, small-scale radio control cars and parts from Japan and Hong Kong. I co-founded **myndrgo** with [Lakshmi Halasyamani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmi-halasyamani-b09b6091) and [Matthew M Davis, MD](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=35745), exploring ways to use technology to empower people to make better health decisions.  

<a href="#/3/2" class="internal">keeping going down, there's more!</a>...  


I co-founded **FLIP-FLOP IO, LLC**, focusing on low-cost home automation solutions, wearables, and STEM tools. And I founded [Rebble Alliance, LLC](http://rebble.io/) - but there's [a whole section coming up on that](#/5)...  
Most recently I founded [oasis AI](https://oasisai.github.io/), with the aim of fostering matches between creative technologists and organizations in need of technological assistance in order to create projects that make a lasting difference.

<a href="#/4" class="internal">back to the main story</a>...  



## The rest...

When I'm not guiding my many ventures (or starting new ones!), [being interviewed for high-profile tech blogs](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-undead-gadgets.html), answering Rebble support tickets, or winning hackathons, I'm mostly focusing on Machine Learning on embedded devices. I attended the first ever [Arm AIoT Dev Summit](http://ishotjr.com/first-arm-aiot-dev-summit-in-pictures/) in December as a guest of Arm, and while I was already extremely interested in this area before, it served as a real catalyst for obsession with this technology.  

<a href="#/4/1" class="internal">more below</a>...  


I founded the offical [tinyML meetup for Michigan](https://www.meetup.com/tinyML-Enabling-low-Power-ML-at-the-edge-Ann-Arbor-MI/), and am an Official Ambassador for [Edge Impulse](https://edgeimpulse.com/). I'm currently working on an ML-powered companion robot pig (with flapping wings!), an ML-enabled baby monitor, and apparently [making The Oatmeal's day](https://twitter.com/Oatmeal/status/1267118660251815937) by creating a [working Quarantine Smartwatch](https://twitter.com/IShJR/status/1266874260750045185).  

<a href="#/5" class="internal">wanna hear some Pebble/Rebble stuff?</a>...  



## Pebble

I was a backer of the [first Pebble](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getpebble/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android?ref=profile_created) and every subsequent model, and would spend all weekend creating watchfaces like [`PW-DOS`](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/550f2f3a46cb79c9bc000044?query=pw-dos&section=watchfaces) and watchapps like [Pokemon GO Radar](http://ishotjr.com/pokemon-go-radar-pebble-watchapp-poc/). Then [Pebble Rocks Boulder](https://www.viget.com/articles/pebble-rocks-boulder-hardware-innovation-packed-into-a-weekend-hackathon/) combined my passion for Pebble with my ferver for hardware hacking and began an even greater obsession. After [winning](https://www.hackster.io/team-hack-dads/pebble-altimeter-smart-strap-aa01b9) that hackathon, I became involved with Pebble in every way I could.

<a href="#/5/1" class="internal">keep going!</a>...  


I became a Pebble "Rockstar", organizing [local meetups](https://www.meetup.com/FitbitARB/photos/28358054/), and working directly with their devrel team. I signed up to be an [appstore](https://apps.rebble.io/) reviewer, helping to select and promote featured apps. I was even a contributor to a [Pebble book](https://pebble.gitbooks.io/learning-c-with-pebble/content/).  

<a href="#/6" class="internal">but then</a>...  



## Rebble

I embraced every Pebble-related opportunity possible - until the fateful day when we learned Pebble was to be no more. This caused me to write [a loveletter to the community](http://ishotjr.com/a-love-letter-to-pebble-and-the-pebble-community/), and more importantly, to [found a new venture, Rebble](https://rebble.io/2016/12/09/rebble-pebble-reborn.html), the unofficial spearhead organization for continuing the advancement of the Pebble platform via the amazing Pebble developer community.  

<a href="#/6/1" class="internal">please keep reading</a>...  


The Rebble journey has been one of the most exciting of my life, resulting in [numerous](https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-undead-gadgets.html) [high](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjkwj/how-pebble-users-are-keeping-the-smartwatch-alive-3-years-after-it-supposedly-died)-[profile](https://www.ifixit.com/News/33398/rebble-with-a-cause-how-pebble-watches-got-their-amazing-afterlife) [interviews](https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/pebble-rebble-june-race-is-on-3001), [podcasts](http://thenexus.tv/episode/ted47/), [international](https://www.meetup.com/Thingscon-Salon/events/260433006/) [presentations](https://ishotjr.github.io/thingscon-salon/), and more. But it's also been a fantastic opportunity to [build community](https://rebble.io/team/), [create content](https://rebble.io/blog/3/), and work directly with [multiple teams of developers](https://github.com/orgs/pebble-dev/people), as well as help new developers who are just starting out with the SDK.

<a href="#/7" class="internal">I also spent the last 7 years as CTO of a venture-backed startup</a>...  



## Larky

[Larky started out](https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/02/larky-raises-650k-to-help-you-redeem-your-membership-program-perks-and-discounts/) as an iOS app designed to remind users of the perks to which they are entitled. When I joined, my mission was to transition the company from outsourcing everything to bringing the product completely in-house.  

<a href="#/7/1" class="internal">what happened next?</a>...  


As we started work on an Android version of the app, we were forced to pivot when the original business model was proven flawed, and suddenly went from having to support a single iOS app to dozens and dozens of branded iOS and Android apps (with a common codebase).  

<a href="#/7/2" class="internal">go on?</a>...  


Based on customer feedback and engagement rates, we pivoted once again and I architected a microservices-backed library, [nudge](https://nudge.larky.com/) (I even came up with the name!) to enable ISVs to imbue their own apps with our location-aware notification functionality.  

<a href="#/7/3" class="internal">this next part is a bit mushy</a>...  


Building a team from nothing, creating the systems required to ship an amazing product from scratch, and mentoring junior and senior developers, as well as interns, was an amazing experience. I was blown away by the outpouring of gratitude and appreciation when I announced my departure, and I hope I can make such a positive impact at my next venture.  

<a href="#/8" class="internal">what was the writing thing?</a>...  



## Hackster News

Lately I've been having a blast [writing for Hackster News](https://www.hackster.io/ishotjr/articles). I've always had a nack for florid verbiage, as demonstrated on my [blog](http://ishotjr.com/) and in my [Rebble content](https://rebble.io/blog/3/), but getting paid to learn and write about the latest SoCs, FPGAs, PCBs and...LOLs - and have my work promoted across Hackster's network of [over a million users](https://www.hackster.io/news/hackster-at-1-000-000-fd539b7af98) - that's pretty cool!  

<a href="#/9" class="internal">is this the end?</a>...
